# pHash unit in PHP
Contains image hashing functions in PHP, compiled from The Net, refactored.
The problem it tries to solve is the difficult compilation of the native dHash extension.
Aims to provide compatible output for its base function - pHash.


Status: most functions return hashes. The pHash() function still looks broken.
Now I'm working on a C-coded PHP extension.
